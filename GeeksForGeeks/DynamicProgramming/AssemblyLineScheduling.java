/**
 * A car factory has two assembly lines, each with n stations. 
 * A station is denoted by Si,j where i is either 1 or 2 and 
 * indicates the assembly line the station is on, and j indicates the number of the station. 
 * The time taken per station is denoted by ai,j. Each station is dedicated to some sort of work 
 * like engine fitting, body fitting, painting and so on. 
 * 
 * So, a car chassis must pass through each of the n stations in order before exiting the factory.
 * The parallel stations of the two assembly lines perform the same task. After it passes through station Si,j, 
 * it will continue to station Si,j+1 unless it decides to transfer to the other line. 
 * Continuing on the same line incurs no extra cost, but transferring from line i at station j â€“ 1 to station j 
 * on the other line takes time ti,j. Each assembly line takes an entry time ei and exit time xi 
 * which may be different for the two lines.
 * 
 * Give an algorithm for computing the minimum time it will take to build a car chassis.
